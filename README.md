# CompositionCase


Problem Statement:

A singleton class needs to have a private constructor, this makes it unfeasible to inherit additional classes.

I have thought about  a way to reuse the implemtation code with in a singleton class in other child like (but Not child ) sigleton classes

This project implents Compostion design pattern between the below 3 singleton classes with out loosing the true single object objective of the singleton class.

The Three singleton classes involved in this project are ....
   AirTrafficControllerUSA.java
   AirTrafficControllerNJ.java
   AirTrafficControllerCA.java
   

The entire project is handcoded to make the above three singleton classes to make sense in a real world like senario with a need for code reuse between them.

# CompositionCase_ An Implementation


Problem Statement:

A singleton class needs to have a private constructor, this makes it unfeasible to inherit additional classes.

I have thought about  a way to reuse the implemtation code with in a singleton class in other child like (but Not child ) sigleton classes

This project implents Compostion design pattern between the below 3 singleton classes with out loosing the true single object objective of the singleton class.

The Three singleton classes involved in this project are


   * AirTrafficControllerUSA.java
   * AirTrafficControllerNJ.java
   * AirTrafficControllerCA.java
   

The entire project is handcoded to make the above three singleton classes to make sense in a real world like senario with a need for code reuse between them.
